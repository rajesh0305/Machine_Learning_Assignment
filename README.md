# Machine_Learning_Assignment
In this repository ,i completed my all Applied Machine Learning course Assignment as well as nitk machine learning assignment
This repository contains Data Science projects in Python programming language completed by me for self-learning and demonstration purposes.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that can help you explore, understand, and clean your dataset effectively:

Data Quality Analysis

Handling missing values (imputation, deletion strategies).
Identifying outliers and dealing with them.
Checking for duplicate entries and removing them if necessary.
Analyzing data types and converting them if needed.
Statistical Summary

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, variance).
Distribution analysis of numerical features.
Skewness and kurtosis to understand feature distributions.
Data Visualization

Univariate analysis (histograms, box plots, violin plots).
Bivariate analysis (scatter plots, heatmaps, pair plots).
Multivariate analysis (correlation matrices, pairwise relationships).
Categorical Data Analysis

Frequency counts and bar plots for categorical variables.
Analyzing relationships between categorical variables (chi-square test).
Encoding categorical features for model readiness.
Feature Interactions

Correlation analysis for numerical features.
Interaction plots to observe relationships between two or more variables.
Feature importance analysis using basic models (for feature selection).
Time Series Analysis (if applicable)

Trends and seasonality in time-based data.
Rolling averages and moving windows.
Decomposing time series into components (trend, seasonality, residuals).
Dimensionality Reduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for high-dimensional data.
t-SNE or UMAP for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.
Anomaly Detection

Identifying rare events or outliers in data.
Techniques like Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, and Local Outlier Factor.
Target Variable Analysis (for supervised learning)

Distribution of the target variable.
Analyzing the relationship between features and the target.
Checking for class imbalance in classification problems.
Feature Engineering & Transformation

Creating new features based on existing ones (e.g., age groups, ratios).
Log transformation, scaling, and normalization.
Polynomial or interaction features for non-linear relationships.
